# k8s-restart

A lightweight REST API for restarting, stopping, and starting Kubernetes workloads via HTTP. Built with .NET 8 and deployable to **any Kubernetes cluster** ‚Äî cloud or on-prem.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Restart all pods in a namespace
- Scale deployments to 0 (stop)
- Restore deployments to their previous replica count (start)
- Restart individual deployments or pods
- Protected with optional Basic Authentication
- Swagger UI built-in

---

## üìò Works With Any Kubernetes Cluster

This service is compatible with:

- ‚úÖ **AKS** (Azure Kubernetes Service)
- ‚úÖ **EKS** (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- ‚úÖ **GKE** (Google Kubernetes Engine)
- ‚úÖ **On-prem clusters** (e.g., kubeadm, Rancher)
- ‚úÖ **kind / minikube / k3s**

> As long as:
> - The cluster supports **standard Kubernetes RBAC**
> - You are running **Kubernetes v1.21+**
> - You apply the **ClusterRole + ServiceAccount + Secret** setup correctly

---

## üîê Authentication

Set the following environment variables to enable Basic Auth:

```bash
ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true
BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=secret
```

When enabled, Swagger will show an "Authorize" button. Without it, the API is unauthenticated (for internal/test use only).

| POST   | `/namespace/{ns}/pod/{pod}/restart`                          | Restart a single pod                             |

## üîê Required ClusterRole and Binding

The service must run with a `ClusterRole` bound to a `ServiceAccount` with access to pods and deployments in **all namespaces**.

### ClusterRole

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: k8s-restart-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "patch", "update"]
```

### ClusterRoleBinding

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: k8s-restart-binding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: k8s-restart
  namespace: kube-system
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: k8s-restart-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### ServiceAccount

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: k8s-restart
  namespace: kube-system
```

---

## üì¶ Deployment

### 1. Create the basic auth secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic k8s-restart-auth \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --from-literal=user=admin \
  --from-literal=password=secret
```

### 2. Apply with Kustomize

```bash
kubectl apply -k k8s/base
```

This deploys:
- The API service
- Ingress
- ServiceAccount
- ClusterRole + Binding

---

## üîé Access

Once deployed, access the Swagger UI at:

```
https://<your-domain>/swagger
```

Log in with Basic Auth if enabled, and interact with the API directly from the browser.
